# Mapic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapic/mapic.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mapic/mapic)

Mapic is an Open Source Web Map Engine. 

Learn more @ https://mapic.io. For a technical overview, please see [Mapic Technical Overview](https://github.com/mapic/mapic/wiki/Mapic-Techincal-Overview).


## Usage
1. Install with `mapic install` (or see below).
2. Start server with `mapic start`.
3. Open your browser @ https://localhost.
4. Stop server with `mapic stop`.


## Install

### Install dependencies: 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) `>= 1.9.0`  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) `>= 1.5.2`  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Install to localhost
Download install script and run install:
```bash

# download mapic
git clone git://github.com/mapic/mapic.git
cd mapic

# Set enviroment variables
export MAPIC_DOMAIN your.domain.com
export MAPIC_ROOT_FOLDER $PWD

# Then install Mapic
mapic install 

```

### Create User
The first user is created automatically. You can log in to [https://localhost](https://localhost) with these default credentials:  

```
username: localhost@mapic.io
password: localhost-password
```

To create another superuser, do:

```bash
# create super user
cd scripts/api
./create-super-user.sh 

```

### Install to custom domain
Install to localhost first, following instructions above; then see [mapic/config-domain.example.com](https://github.com/mapic/config-domain.example.com) for instructions on changing configs for custom domain.

If installing on a publicly available domain, it's important to flush the default `localhost@mapic.io` superuser account first, for obvious reasons. Simply run this script, and the user is removed:

```bash
# flush localhost user
cd scripts/api
./flush-localhost-user.sh

```

## Libraries
Mapic consists of:   
1. [Mapic Engine](https://github.com/mapic/engine)  
2. [Mapic Mile Tileserver](https://github.com/mapic/mile)    
3. [Mapic Javascript Client library](https://github.com/mapic/mapic.js)    
4. [Mapic SDK](https://github.com/mapic/sdk) (for interacting with API programmatically)

Mapic is built on Docker. Docker Images for Mapic are available on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mapic/).
